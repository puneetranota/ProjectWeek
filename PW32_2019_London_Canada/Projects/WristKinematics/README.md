## Wrist Kinematics from 4D CT

## Key Investigators
- Puneet Kaur Ranota (Western University) 

# Project Description
We are looking to investigate the distance between bones in the wrist from 4DCT images.

## Objective
1. Load static CT into Slicer
1. Load 4D cine CT into Slicer
1. Create 3D reconstructions of the radius, ulna, capitate, scaphoid, lunate, and 3rd metacarpal

## Approach and Plan

1. Describe planned approach to reach objectives.
1. ...
1. ...

## Progress and Next Steps

1. MultiVolumeImporter patched to recognize GE Revolution 4D Cine sequence separator field
1. Segment editor tutorial for bone segmentation
